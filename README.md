## üåê **Overview**

**`epicchain-js`** is a comprehensive Node.js package designed specifically for developers and blockchain enthusiasts to interact with the **EpicChain blockchain** effortlessly. This package acts as a bridge between your application and the EpicChain network, allowing you to synchronize and query blockchain data, manage nodes, and easily perform various blockchain operations using JavaScript.

EpicChain is built for scalability, speed, and security, and `epicchain-js` fully utilizes these features. By integrating MongoDB as a storage backend, you can synchronize the blockchain state across nodes, making the entire process faster and more reliable.

This tool can be used in various scenarios such as:

- Running **full nodes** for the EpicChain blockchain.
- Interacting with the blockchain‚Äôs **RPC methods**.
- Synchronizing blockchain data with MongoDB for permanent storage.
- **Querying** blockchain information, such as block height, transaction details, and more.

---

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

To begin working with `epicchain-js`, it's essential to ensure that your development environment meets the necessary requirements and dependencies. Follow the instructions below to set everything up properly.

### üìù **Preparations**

Before diving into the code, ensure that you have **MongoDB** installed and properly configured. MongoDB 3.2 or newer is required to handle the blockchain synchronization and storage features provided by this package. MongoDB will store blockchain data locally, ensuring efficient and quick access to blockchain state across your applications.

- **MongoDB Installation**: You can install MongoDB via [MongoDB‚Äôs official website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
- **MongoDB Connection**: Ensure that MongoDB is running on your local machine or a remote server, and you have the appropriate connection string to use it in your project.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **System Requirements**

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** v8 or above (LTS versions are recommended for stability).
- **MongoDB** v3.2+ (This is a critical requirement for synchronizing data with the blockchain).

If you're unfamiliar with how to install **Node.js** or **MongoDB**, here are some quick resources:
- [Node.js Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB Installation Guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

## üì¶ **Installation**

To get started with `epicchain-js`, install it using **npm**, the Node.js package manager. This package can be installed directly from the npm registry, ensuring that you always get the latest stable version.

1. **Basic Installation**:
   
   Use the following command to install the package in your project:
   
   ```bash
   $ npm install --save @epicchain/epicchain-js
   ```

2. **Installing the Development Version**:

   If you want to experiment with the latest code or contribute to the project, you can install the development version directly from the GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   $ npm install --save git://github.com/epicchainlabs/epicchain-js.git#develop
   ```

This will install the latest development changes, but please note that this version may be less stable than the official release.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Quick Start**

Once installed, you can start using `epicchain-js` in your project. Here‚Äôs a simple walkthrough to get you started with **EpicChain** interactions.

### **Step 1: Import the Package**

In your project‚Äôs entry file, import the `epicchain-js` module like this:

```js
const EpicChain = require('@epicchain/epicchain-js').EpicChain;
```

This will give you access to all the functionality you need to interact with the EpicChain blockchain.

### **Step 2: Connecting to a Network**

You can choose between connecting to the **testnet** or the **mainnet**. Both networks offer real-time blockchain data, but the testnet is safer for experimentation and testing purposes.

#### Example for **Testnet**:

```js
// Create an instance for the testnet
const testnetEpicChain = new EpicChain({ network: 'testnet' });

// Wait for the node to be ready before making API calls
testnetEpicChain.mesh.on('ready', () => {
  // Fetch block count from the testnet
  testnetEpicChain.api.getBlockCount().then((res) => {
    console.log('Testnet Block Count:', res);
  });
});
```

#### Example for **Mainnet**:

```js
// Create an instance for the mainnet
const mainnetEpicChain = new EpicChain({ network: 'mainnet' });

// Wait for the node to be ready before making API calls
mainnetEpicChain.mesh.on('ready', () => {
  // Fetch block data for block number 1000 from the mainnet
  mainnetEpicChain.api.getBlock(1000).then((res) => {
    console.log('Mainnet Block 1000 Hash:', res.hash);
  });
});
```

## ‚ö° **Node Setup with MongoDB Synchronization**

Once your instance is set up, you can start interacting with the **EpicChain** node and synchronize it with **MongoDB**. This allows your node to track the state of the blockchain and store data in a local database for fast retrieval.

### Example Configuration:

```js
const options = {
  network: 'testnet', // Specify the network (testnet or mainnet)
  storageType: 'mongodb', // Use MongoDB for data synchronization
  storageOptions: {
    connectionString: 'mongodb://localhost/epicchain_testnet', // Connection string for MongoDB
  },
};

// Create the EpicChain instance with the options
const epicchain = new EpicChain(options);

// Wait for the storage to be ready and fetch the highest block height
epicchain.storage.on('ready', () => {
  epicchain.storage.getHighestBlockHeight().then((res) => {
    console.log('Highest Block Height:', res);
  });
});
```

This setup will connect your node to **MongoDB** and synchronize the blockchain data for efficient querying and storage.
